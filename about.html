                <h2>About the Interstellar Armada application</h2>
                <p>
                    This application is a learning project in the early development phase.
                    The current version is only intended for testing the initial, already
                    implemented features of what one day might become a functional game.
                    Even the core features are yet under development. The application
                    might contain numerous bugs.
                </p>

                <h2>About the used technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is written in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, without the usage of third
                    party libraries. <strong>WebGL</strong> is used for 3D graphics, with shaders written in <strong>GLSL</strong>.<br/>
                    <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> are used for 
                    generating and styling the pages seen in the game.<br/>
                    The configuration files use the <strong>XML</strong> format, and the
                    3D model geometries are stored in the egm (EgomModel) file format, which is also
                    well formed XML generated by a modeling library developed by the same author.

This is the readme file for the Interstellar Armada (working name) program.
With any questions, turn to the author Krisztián Nagy <nkrisztian89@gmail.com>.

Interstellar Armada is JavaScript application currently in the early development 
phase.

It is a game set in a space environment far in the future.
As of the moment, the player can control one spaceship and fly around, as well 
as fire the ship's weapons.

================================================================================
LAUNCHING THE APP
================================================================================

To start, load index.html. You will see a menu, from where you can
- launch the game (can also be done directly by loading up armada.html in your
browser)
- examine the keyboard controls (highly recommended as the program lacks 
any decent UI for controls at the moment)
- take a look at the documentation automatically generated by jsdoc (it is very
far from complete)

Note that the application will load a lot of data (mostly geometry for models),
therefore it can take quite a while (15-30 seconds) before you see the "ready"
message - this might look like your browser is frozen, but most probably it is 
not, just be patient.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRYING IT OUT
================================================================================

After the program loads, use the arrow keys and page up/down to move around the 
camera. Press ctrl and the arrow keys to turn around.

Once you've taken a look, press C to get the camera follow a spacecraft. You can 
press C multiple times to cycle through the spaceships and then eventually get 
back to free camera controls. Pressing X will bring you back to the previous 
ship.

To inspect a ship a bit more, press V multiple times while the camera is fixed 
on it. This will bring you to the different camera views available for that 
ship, some of which allow you to turn around, again using ctrl and the arrow 
key.

When you've found your favourite spacecraft, press M to assume manual control of 
it. Now you can turn the ship around using its thrusters by pressing the arrow 
keys and  page up/down. You can fire the ship's weapons by pressing space.

To move around, you have two options.
The game uses realistic (simplified) physics, which means since we're in space, 
nothing will stop your craft if it starts moving in one direction.
You can experience this fully in the default "free" flight mode. Pressing W will 
fire your rear thrusters and pressing S will fire your forward thursters, 
accelerating your ship forward or backward, then you can turn around and see how 
it keeps it's speed.

This can be very tricky to control. To help this, press O to switch to 
"compensated" flight mode. In this mode, W and S can be used to adjust your 
intended speed (you can see it at the bottom of the screen) instead of firing 
the thrusters directly. Then the computer will automatically fire the needed 
thrusters to accelerate or deccelerate you to this speed as well as to 
compensate for any drift your ship might have sideways.
You can maneuver an agile fighter comfortably this way flying around 50-100 m/s.

NOTICE
================================================================================

It was mainly intended to be a learning project for me to practice and develop
my JavaScript and WebGL skills, therefore I made my design choices based on what
helped me to learn more about the fundaments and particulars of these 
technologies. (hence not using any 3rd party WebGL or physics library, etc)

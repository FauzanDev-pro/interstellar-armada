Interstellar Armada is JavaScript-WebGL based space combat simulator game in the 
early development phase by Krisztián Nagy 
(<nkrisztian89@gmail.com>) The core features of the game are still under 
development.

The game and the source code is released under [GNU GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/). 
The source includes a version of [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), which has separate license.
All licenses can be found in the *license* folder of the game.

Try it
======

Though the game is very far from being ready, it is possible to try out the
already implemented features. **Just head to [this page]
(http://nkrisztian89.github.io/interstellar-armada/) to launch the game right
from your browser.**

If you experience performance issues, adjust the level of detail from the menu.
As this is an early version, the performance is subject to changes (and bugs).
The perfomance also greatly varies depending on the used browser. In my experience,
on most configurations **Chrome** provides the best experience, followed by **Firefox**,
with other browsers lagging behind.

While in the game, you can press `esc` to bring up the in-game menu (according
to default settings), where you can also check the controls.

For developers
==============

I use [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) (8.1) with its web development (+
[JSLint](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/40893/jslint),
[GLSL](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/46515/glsl-syntax-highlighter) and 
[Markdown](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/50964/markdown-support)) plugins 
to develop this application.

It was mainly intended to be a _learning project_ for me to practice and develop
my JavaScript and WebGL skills, therefore I made my design choices based on what
helped me to learn more about these technologies. (hence not using any 3rd party 
WebGL or physics library, etc)
